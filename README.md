# Hi there ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‘‹, my name is Alessandro Moraes

# About me
- I'm a brazillian Software Engineering student. I'm currently learning Python and Data Analysis with Python.
- My favorite hobbies are reading, hitting the gym and playing video games, so when I'm not here posting/updating code, I'm probably doing one of those.

# What i'm learning now
- At the moment I'm studying some of the main Python libraries, like Selenium and Scikit-learn.
- I've also begun learning another programming language, JavaScript.
